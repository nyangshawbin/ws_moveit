## Summary:

This repo contains a work-in-progress project. Currently, it has the following few features:
1. [Demo Package](#demo) 
   * Visualize robot's joints through Rviz GUI slider.
   * Publish joint goal position to Gazebo robot directly.
   
2. [Moveit Package](#moveit)
   * Execute planned trajectory from MoveIt onto Gazebo robot.
   * Moveit Commander Scripting.
   
3. [Move Group C++ interface](#move-group-cpp-interface)
   * Using MoveGroupInterface class to carry out most operations. 

4. [Hardware Package](#hardware)
   * Documentation on low level control.
   
## Demo
### Rviz GUI
![Robot joint rviz GUI image](https://github.com/nyangshawbin/ws_moveit/blob/master/images/robot_rviz.gif)

```
roslaunch moveit_demo robot_rviz.launch
```

### Gazebo Joint Position Control
![Gazebo demo image](https://github.com/nyangshawbin/ws_moveit/blob/master/images/robot_gazebo_demo.gif)

```
roslaunch moveit_demo robot_world.launch

roslaunch moveit_demo robot_control.launch
```

#### Example: 
```
rostopic pub /robot/joint1_position_controller/command std_msgs/Float64 "data: -1.2"
```  

## MoveIt

### Execute motion planned by MoveIt 
![Execute trajectory image](https://github.com/nyangshawbin/ws_moveit/blob/master/images/moveit_motion_planning.gif)

Launch robot in gazebo with its controller loaded

```
roslaunch robot_gazebo robot_gazebo.launch
```

Run main moveit file

```
roslaunch robot_moveit robot_planning_execution.launch
```

Change state in planning tab of Motion Planning plugin. Plan and execute to visualize change in Gazebo.

### MoveIt Commander Scripting

![Command line control image](https://github.com/nyangshawbin/ws_moveit/blob/master/images/command_line_control.gif)

To control simulated robot in gazebo using [command line](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/moveit_commander_scripting/moveit_commander_scripting_tutorial.html): 
```
rosrun moveit_commander moveit_commander_cmdline.py
```

## Move Group Cpp Interface

Launch robot in gazebo and main Moveit file as before

```
roslaunch robot_gazebo robot_gazebo.launch

roslaunch robot_moveit robot_planning_execution.launch
```
Run the launch file, use the [RvizVisualToolsGui](http://docs.ros.org/melodic/api/moveit_tutorials/html/doc/quickstart_in_rviz/quickstart_in_rviz_tutorial.html#rviz-visual-tools) panel to step through the demo

```
roslaunch moveit_tutorials move_group_robot.launch
```
### Expected output:
Each step can be visualized in Rviz, and motion executed on Gazebo Robot.

  1. Robot moves arm to pose goal.
  2. Robot moves arm to along cartesian waypoints.
  3. Robot moves its arm to joint goal.
  4. A box object is added into the environment to the left of the arm.
  5. Robot moves its arm to the new pose goal, avoiding collision with the box
  6. The object is attached to the robot (its color will change to purple/orange/green).
  7. The object is detached from the wrist (its color will change back to green).
  8. The object is removed from the environment.
