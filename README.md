# Summary

Packages for MoveIt motion planning. ROS packages can be used to plan and execute trajectories for both simulated robot in Gazebo and real world robot, as listed below respectively:

1. Motion planning on a simulated 6-DOF [robot](https://github.com/nyangshawbin/ws_moveit/tree/master/robot) in Gazebo.

2. Motion planning on a real-world 2-DOF [arm](https://github.com/nyangshawbin/ws_moveit/tree/master/arm) using Arduino and Servo.

I currently have this repo 'ws_moveit' in the 'src' folder of my catkin workspace.
