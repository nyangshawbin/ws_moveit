# Summary

Workspace for MoveIt motion planning. ROS packages can be used to plan and execute trajectories for both simulated robot in Gazebo and real world robot, as listed below respectively:

1. Motion planning on a 6-DOF [robot](https://github.com/nyangshawbin/ws_moveit/tree/master/robot) in Gazebo simulation.

2. Motion planning on a 2-DOF [arm](https://github.com/nyangshawbin/ws_moveit/tree/master/arm) in real-world using Arduino and Servo.
